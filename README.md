# Docker
Docker is a **container** technology: A tool for creating and managing containers

* Container: A standardized unit of software (A package of code **and** dependencies to run that code)

> The same container always yields[produce or provide] the **exact same application and execution behavior** No matter where or by whom it might be executed.


##Â Images and Containers

**Images** are the templates/blueprints for containers

**Containers** are the running "unit of software" (concrete running instance)


> We can create images based on others images

---

> Images are Read Only. **The image is a "snapshot" of the latest version of the code when the image was created.**


### Layer based architecture

whenever you build an image, Docker caches every instruction result, and when you then rebuild an image, it will use these cached results if there is no need to run an instruction again.

> Every instruction into the Dockerfile is a layer. The **CMD** instruction is a layer that will only exist when the container is running.
